My contribution to Group Assignment #1: GPR and IR

# Quick Note
Both the GPR and IR share the same circuit design, which is why I have only uploaded one file. Despite this similarity, they serve different purposes: the GPR is used for temporary data storage during computation, while the IR specifically holds the current instruction for decoding and execution.
